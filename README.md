# ÍY SȻÁĆEL (Good Day/Hello) 👋🏽

My name is **Caleb M. Irvine** (He/Him). I am a **STÁUTW (Tsawout) First Nation** student in my second year, and soon to be final summer term of the Information and Computer Systems Technologist Diploma program at Camosun College.

I have work experience in Apple hardware repairs, Apple Sales, and currently serve in a **Junior System Analyst** role, where I further develop my skills in Apple-based workflow solutions.

I look forward to the new connections I meet in the community, and to strengthening the connections I continue to have.
